# Persian-Calendar-Holiday-Events-Web-Scraping-Project
This project uses web scraping to collect data about Persian holidays and events from the time.ir website. It extracts event details for the years 1395 to 1403 and saves them in a CSV file. The project demonstrates the use of Pythonâ€™s requests and pandas libraries for data retrieval and organization in scenarios without available APIs.
